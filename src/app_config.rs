The result of analyzing an ERC-20 contract’s source code for potential scams or malicious features, including stats on tokens holders, liquidity, and online presence.

This provided assessment will have the following field: 

    - token_name
    - token_address
    - token_symbol

    - possible_scam (boolean)

    // 2 to 3 sentences as to why (or why not) its a scam
    - reason_possible_scam 

    // could suspicious code be justified as legitimate to counter bots and snippers?
    - could_legitimately_justify_suspicious_code (boolean)

    // 2 to 3 sentences as to why (or why not) suspicious could be justified
    - reason_could_or_couldnt_justify_suspicious_code

    // what percentage of tokens does top token holder own?
    - top_holder_percentage_tokens_held (0.0 to 100.0)

    // percentage of total tokens minted that are locked or burned (ie not avaliable for circulation)
    - percentage_of_tokens_locked_or_burned (0.0 to 100.0)

    // what percentage of LP (liquidity tokens) is locked (in 3rd party locker) or burned (pointing to zero/dead address)

    - has_website (boolean)

    // does token have a twitter profile or discord channel
    - has_twitter_or_discord (boolean)

    // Is token sellable or transferable when simulating swap with foundry anvil?
    - is_token_sellable: Some(true or false), if None then could not run simulation, and result is indetermined

Based on these inputs, please make a wholistic determination on the legitimacy of the token and return one the following scores:

4 - Legit,
3 - Likely Legit,
2 - Iffy,
1 - Likely Scam,
0 - Scam,

*Note: if token is well known token with an established high reputation and history, then score the token as "4 - Legit"

Your **output must be strictly valid JSON** (no extra text or code fencing), in this format:

{
  "token_score": "4 - Legit" | "3 - Likely Legit" | "2 - Iffy" | "1 - Likely Scam" | "0 - Scam",
  "reason": "<5_to_7_sentences_explaining_in_detail_why_token_recieved_specified_score>",
}

Where:
- `token_score` is a token reputation score that must be one of the following values: "4 - Legit", "3 - Likely Legit", "2 - Iffy", "1 - Likely Scam", or "0 - Scam",
- `reason` is a 5 to 7 sentence justification of token score.

Return **only** valid JSON. Do NOT include triple backticks or any other formatting around the JSON.

pub const FINAL_DETERMINATION_PROMPT: &str = r#"You are a senior crypto investigator. I will provide two JSON assessments:

1. The result of analyzing an ERC-20 contract’s source code for potential scams or malicious features.
2. The result of analyzing the project's website for credibility.

Each assessment will have a `"possible_scam"` boolean and a `"reason"` field, plus additional summary/context if available. Using these two inputs, please:

1. Combine the findings: If the website is credible but the code is suspicious (or vice versa), decide whether the suspicious code might be legitimately used to defend against malicious trading bots, front-running, sniping, etc.
2. Make a final determination: Is this token possibly a scam or not?

Your **output must be strictly valid JSON** (no extra text or code fencing), in this format:

{
  "final_scam_assessment": <true_or_false>,
  "reason": "<2-3_sentences_explaining_why_you_concluded_scam_or_not>",
  "could_legitimately_justify_suspicious_code": <true_or_false>
}

Where:
- `final_scam_assessment` is a Boolean indicating if you think the token is likely a scam overall.
- `reason` is a concise (2–3 sentences) explanation.
- `could_legitimately_justify_suspicious_code` is a Boolean indicating whether the suspicious code could be explained by legitimate anti-bot or anti-exploit measures.

pub const CODE_CHECK_PROMPT: &str = r#"You are an expert Solidity security reviewer. I will provide you with an ERC-20 contract source code. You need to check whether this contract has any signs of being a rug pull, honeypot, or other scam.

Pay special attention to:
1. The transfer function or `_transfer` logic (any hidden conditions or blacklists).
2. Ownership methods (`Ownable`, `renounceOwnership`, etc.) and whether ownership is *actually* renounced—or if there is a hidden or alternate owner variable.
3. Any ability for the owner or privileged account to mint additional tokens.
4. Any external calls or “rescue tokens,” “withdraw,” or “removeLiquidity” methods that could drain user funds or liquidity.
5. Unusually high or dynamically modifiable fees that could be set to extreme values.
6. Proxy or upgradeable patterns that could hide malicious updates later.
7. Any hidden or custom logic that prevents selling or imposes heavy taxes on sellers.
8. Disregard any trust signals such as "renounced ownership" or "burned liquidity" unless it is clear there is *no* backdoor enabling the developer to regain control or drain liquidity.

After analyzing these points, respond **strictly** in the following JSON format (no additional text). The `reason` should not exceed 2 to 3 sentences:

{ 
  "possible_scam": <true_or_false>, 
  "reason": "<2_or_3_sentences_describing_rationale>" 
  "could_legitimately_justify_suspicious_code": <true_or_false>
  "reason_could_be_legitimate_or_not": <2_or_3_sentences_describing_rationale>
}

*Note*: 

- `could_legitimately_justify_suspicious_code` is a Boolean indicating whether the suspicious code could reasonably be explained by legitimate anti-bot, anti-snipper, or anti-exploit measures,
 that could be implimented by legitimate smart contracts. . If there is no suspicious code just set to true.
`reason_could_be_legitimate_or_not` - If you set `could_legitimately_justify_suspicious_code` to true, THEN explain in a couple sentences WHY any suspicious code in contract could be legitimate anti-bot/anti-snipper/anti-exploit measures, 
 however if you set `could_legitimately_justify_suspicious_code` to false explain WHY. If there is no suspicious code just state "code is legitimate".

Please only produce valid JSON—no code fencing or extra explanation. Provide a Boolean for `possible_scam`.

1. Determine if the website seems credible or if it exhibits potential scam signals.  
2. Focus on any obvious contradictions, fake partnerships, poorly written or copy-pasted content, unrealistic claims, or missing critical information (e.g., team info, roadmap, contact details).  
3. Summarize the site’s content (in your own words) and highlight any suspicious indicators.

2. Look for inconsistencies, copy-pasted or repetitive “shilling,” unrealistic claims, suspicious engagement patterns, or evidence of bot activity. Also note any red flags from extremely low engagement relative to follower count, newly created accounts with huge follower spikes, or significant mismatches between followers and actual interactions.
3. Summarize the account’s overall behavior (in your own words) and highlight any red flags that might indicate a scam. This summary should be no longer than 500 tokens.
